# Automatic Call Distributor and Optimizer

# Abstract
Call queues are central to the effectiveness of call centres and customer service. Call centres use a variety of methods, tools, and practices to lower the average
time that a caller spends in the call queue. The goal is to have the lowest
average call queue time possible, which will result in more effective service and
happier customers. It is imperative that call centre queues be consistently
monitored and actions be taken to reduce queue wait time. Effective call centre
interactions will communicate to the customer that your company is dedicated
to assessing their needs and resolving their issue. It can result in the
identification of new sales opportunities, increase loyalty and promote positive
brand awareness. Every company has to make sure that they are answering the
phones promptly.

# What is a Call Queue?
Call queuing is a concept used in inbound call centres. When calling a phone
system that uses call queues, callers usually hear a welcome message and an
IVR menu and are then sent into a call queue, where they hear waiting music
and position announcements until an agent becomes available. The normal
distribution approach in call queues is first in, first out. Call centres use an
Automatic Call Distributor (ACD) to distribute incoming calls to specific
resources (agents) in the centre. ACDs hold queued calls until agents become
available. So basically in this project Iâ€™ll be trying to replicate this process in a
more simpler way using the Data Structure called Queue. Queue is an abstract
data structure, somewhat similar to Stacks. Unlike stacks, a queue is open at
both its ends. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is
used to remove data (dequeue). Queue follows First-In-First-Out methodology, i.e., the data item stored first will be accessed first. Hence implying a sense of
priority that will be emulated here as the first person to call will be responded to first.
